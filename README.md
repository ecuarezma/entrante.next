# Project

This is an old website I initally started in college using Dreamweaver...back in 2005/2006. I have since revisited this site many times in order to implement new technologies and techniques I have learned along the way. This is, in short, a testing playground to try and write more concise and effective code.

## Using Next.js

I am rebuilding this website using Next.js and React. Very excited to bring about a responsive and super speedy app. It is still in development, so feel free to visit often and see the progress in action!
